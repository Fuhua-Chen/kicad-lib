$CMP ISD9160CFI
D Nuvoton;ISD9160;The ISD9160 is a system-on-chip product optimized for low power, audio record and playback with anembedded ARM® Cortex™-M0 32-bit microcontroller core.The ISD9160 embeds a Cortex™-M0 core running up to 50 MHz with 145K-byte of non-volatile flashmemory and 12K-byte of embedded SRAM. It also comes equipped with a variety of peripheral devices, such as Timers, Watchdog Timer (WDT), Real-time Clock (RTC), Peripheral Direct Memory Access (PDMA), a variety of serial interfaces (UART, SPI/SSP, I2C, Analog Comparator, Low Voltage Detector and Brown-out detector. The ISD9160 comes equipped with a rich set of power saving modes including a Deep Power Down (DPD) mode drawing less than 1uA. A micro-power 16KHz oscillator can periodically wake up the device from deep power down to check for other events. A Standby Power Down (SPD) mode can maintain a real time clock function at less than 10uA. For audio functionality the ISD9160 includes a Sigma-Delta ADC with 92dB SNR performance coupled with a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) capable of a maximum gain of 61dB to enable direct connection of a microphone. Audio output is provided by a Differential Class D amplifier (DPWM) that can deliver 1W of power to an 8Ω speaker. The ISD9160 provides eight analog enabled general purpose IO pins (GPIO). These pins can be configured to connect to an analog comparator, can be configured as analog current sources or can be routed to the SDADC for analog conversion. They can also be used as a relaxation oscillator to perform capacitive touch sensing.
