$CMP BL1551
D The BL1551 is a Single Wide-Bandwidth, fast singlepole double-throw (SPDT) CMOS switch featuring an On-Resistance of 2.7 ohm at VCC=5.0V and wide power supply range from 1.8V to 5.5V. It can be used as an analog switch or as a low-delay bus switch. The 300MHz high bandwidth performance supports the high frequency application. Break-before-make function for both parts eliminates signal disruption during switching from preventing both switches being enabled simultaneously.
