$CMP 74LVC1T45DW-7
D The  74LVC1T45  is  a  single  bit,  dual  supply  transceiver  with  3-state outputs  suitable  for  transmitting  a  single  logic  bit  across  different voltage  domains.  The  A  input/output  pin  is  designed  to  track  VCCA while  the  B  input/output  tracks  VCCB.  This  arrangement  allows  for universal low-voltage translation between any voltages from 1.65V to 5.5V. The Direction pin (DIR) controls the direction of the transceiver and  in  a  logic  voltage  related  to  VCCA.  When  a  high  logic  level  is applied to DIR the A pin becomes an input and the B pin becomes the output.  Conversely,  the  roles  of  A  and  B  are  reversed  when  DIR  is asserted low. The  3-state  feature  occurs  when  either  of  the  power  supply  voltages are  zero.  This  is  also  an  Ioff  feature  and  allows  for  the  output  to remain  in  a  high  impedance  state  with  both  power  supplies  at  0V,preventing  and  damaging  backflow  currents  and  providing  power down  electrical  isolation  up to  5.5V as  not  to  interfere  with  any  logic activity on pin A or B.

$CMP NL17SZ32XV5T2G
D The NL17SZ32 is a single 2−input OR Gate in three tiny footprint packages. The device performs much as LCX multi−gate products in speed and drive. They should be used wherever the need for higher speed and drive are needed.
