$CMP CESD5V0D3
D The CESD5V0D3 is designed to protect voltage sensitive components from ESD. Excellent clamping capability, low leakage, and fast response time provide best in class protection on designs that are exposed to ESD. Because of its small size, it is suited for use in cellular phones, MP3 players, digital cameras and many other portable applications where board space is at a premium.

$CMP ST;USBLC6-2
D The USBLC6-2SC6 and USBLC6-2P6 are monolithic application specific devices dedicated to ESD protection of high speed interfaces, such as USB 2.0, Ethernet links and video lines. The very low line capacitance secures a high level of signal integrity without compromising in protecting sensitive chips against the most stringently characterized ESD strikes.
