$CMP FM25F01-TS-T-G
D The FM25FF01 is a 1M-bit(128K-byte)Serial Flash memory, with advanced writer protection mechanisms. The FM25F01 support the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance Dual output as well as Dual IO. The FM25F01 can be programmed 1 to256 bytes at a time,using the Page Program instruction, It is designed to allow either single Sector/Block at a time or full chip erase operation.The FM25F01 can be configured to protect part of the memory as the software protected mode. The Device can sustain a minimum of 100k program/erasw cycles on each sector or block.

$CMP P25Q16H-SSH-IT
D The P25Q16H is a serial interface Flash memory device designed for use in a wide variety of high-volume consumer based applications in which program code is shadowed from Flash memory into embedded or external RAM for execution. The flexible erase architecture of the device, with its page erase granularity it is ideal for data storage as well, eliminating the need for additional data storage devices.The erase block sizes of the device have been optimized to meet the needs of today's code and data storage applications. By optimizing the size of the erase blocks, the memory space can be used much more efficiently. Because certain code modules and data storage segments must reside by themselves in their own erase regions, the wasted and unused memory space that occurs with large sectored and large block erase Flash memory devices can be greatly reduced. This increased memory space efficiency allows additional code routines and data storage segments to be added while still maintaining the same overall device density.The device also contains an additional 3*512-byte security registers with OTP lock (One-Time Programmable), can be used for purposes such as unique device serialization, system-level Electronic Serial Number (ESN) storage, locked key storage, etc.Specifically designed for use in many different systems, the device supports read, program, and erase operations with a wide supply voltage range of 2.30V to 3.6V. No separate voltage is required for programming and erasing.

$CMP W25Q64JVSSIQ
D The W25Q64JV (64M-bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code directly from Dual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operates on 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 1ÂµA for power-down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages.  The W25Q64JV array is organized into 32,768 programmable pages of 256-bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q64JV has 2,048 erasable sectors and 128 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See Figure 2.)  The W25Q64JV supports the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 and I/O3. SPI clock frequencies of W25Q64JV of up to 133MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz (133MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 532MHz (133MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories.Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID, and a 64-bit Unique Serial Number and three 256-bytes Security Registers.
